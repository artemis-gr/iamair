                            <p>IAMAIR is an agency based in the Netherlands, working at the intersection of art performance and cultural mediation. Our aim is to facilitate 
interaction with audiences in cultural institutions through unexpected narratives co-created with artists and performers, building bridges between cultural institutions and 
international and local communities. We work with diverse cultural makers, connect artists, mediators and performers with people beyond the field of art, and facilitate the 
co-creation of disruptive interventions in socially normative contexts.</p>

                            <h4 class="label-homepage">ARTISTS AND AUDIENCES AS KNOWLEDGE CREATORS</h4>
                            <p>Traditional dynamics in cultural institutions often portray audiences as passive recipients of education and artists as almost godly inspired 
figures, 
which upon not accurately reflecting the reality of contemporary artists' lives, also widens the gap between cultural institutions and society. Consequently, museums grow 
increasingly empty and disconnected from their collective mission. IAMAIR seeks to shift these dynamics by placing artists and audiences at the forefront of knowledge 
creation.</p>

                            <h4 class="label-homepage">A COMMUNITY OF AUDIENCES</h4>
                            <p>Recognizing the need for cultural institutions to engage more audiences, our agency represents a community of audiences for various types of 
cultural 
endeavors. They include cultural makers, artists, actors and performers, all potential participants in the co-creation of our interventions. They infiltrate museums, 
galleries, 
exhibitions, and heritage sites, seamlessly melting within the landscape to whisper other stories.</p>

                            <h4 class="label-homepage">BLURRING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN FICTION AND REALITY</h4>
                            <p>Our interventions take the form of infiltrative role-play performances based on site-specific parameters, such as art works, architecture, 
stakeholders 
and policies. Operating on the border where fiction meets reality, we seek to break the wall between visitors and performers, between reality and performance. Our practice is 
intentionally anchored in the uncertainty of the responsive environment, embracing serendipity and ambiguity as vehicles for research, improvement and discovery.</p>

                            <p>This agency is part of an artistic research in progress. Improvements and changes are in development, and we are indefinitely working on a new 
version 
of this website. Our pilot performance took place at Depot Boijmans in Rotterdam on 2 March 2024, and is being revised for its final version. We are also looking for new 
partners 
interested in joining the project. Help us improve by sending questions, feedback, and comments to <a href="mailto:contact@iamair.nl">contact@iamair.nl</a>.</p>
